# Project Version Updater

Update a project's version with the option to also increase the version of all projects inside a solution dependening on this project.

In a solution of multiple projects connected by project references that are releasable as NuGet packages it is challenging to version each project correctly: At NuGet package creation project references are converted to package references. In the process of updating a project it is therefore crucial to also update the version of all projects that depend on it. Given you have the following project graph `A <== B <== C` with project B dependening on project A and project C depending on project B. In case you need to update project A you automatically have to update project B and C to make them use the correct NuGet package version of the updated project A. When done by hand this update process is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool helps you achive this task fast and reliably.  

Example usage:

Increase the version of project `ExampleProject` by one minor version and make it a prerelease. The versions of all projects within the solution which depend on this project will be increased by one patch prerelease version. 

```powershell
PS> dotnet update-project --update minor --prerelease --dependants .\ExampleProject.csproj
```

## Prerequisites

- .NET >= 6.0.413
- PowerShell Core is recommended for running all commands in this repository

## Installation

To install this tool in your workspace execute the following command:

```powershell
PS> dotnet tool install --local ProjectVersionUpdater
```

## General Usage

```powershell
PS> dotnet update-project [options] <argument>
```

### Arguments

- `ProjectPath` (required): The path to the project file to update

### Options

- `-u` | `--update` (optional): Indicates which version part to increase: major, minor or patch. Defaults to major if omitted.
- `-p` | `--prerelease` (optional):  Indicates if version update should be a prerelease. If no value is provided the naming schema defaults to.
- `-n` | `--name` (optional): Use a custom prerelease label. If omitted the default prelease naming scheme is used: '<version>-[major|minor|patch].[number]'.
- `-d` | `--dependants` (optional): Indicates if all projects which are (transitevely) dependent on the project to update should be updated as well.

## Usage Examples

Update a project to its next major version. Update all its dependent projects to the next patch version.

```powershell
PS> dotnet update-project --update major --dependants .\Project.csproj
```

Update a project to its next minor prerelease version. Update all its dependent projects to the next patch prerelease version.

```powershell
PS> dotnet update-project --update major --prerelease --dependants .\Project.csproj
```

Update a project with a prerelease version to its next release version. Update all its dependent projects to the next patch release. Projects with release versions will be increased by 1, projects with prerelease versions will be increased to the next patch release version

```powershell
PS> dotnet update-project --update minor --dependants .\Project.csproj
```

Update multiple projects to its next release version. Update all their dependant projects to the next patch release.

```powershell
PS> dotnet update-project --update major --dependants .\Project.csproj .\Project.Abstractions.csproj
```
